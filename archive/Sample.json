        "instructions": "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0. Enclose fennel seeds in resealable plastic bag; using mallet, coarsely crack seeds. (Alternatively, crack seeds in mortar with pestle.) Mix seeds, smoked paprika, brown sugar, crushed red pepper, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in small bowl to blend. Place pork on sheet of foil. Sprinkle spice mixture all over pork and roll pork on foil sheet, pressing firmly so spices will adhere. Heat oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Add pork to pot and sear until brown on all sides, 8 to 9 minutes. Add 3 cups broth and any seasoning mixture remaining on sheet of foil; bring to boil. Cover pot tightly and transfer to oven. Braise until pork is very tender, turning pork every 30 minutes, about 2 hours total. Remove pot from oven. Uncover pot and cool pork in pot 1 hour. Transfer pork to cutting board. Cut pork into 1/2- to 3/4-inch cubes. Spoon off fat from top of sauce in pot. Return pork cubes to sauce in pot. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm pork and sauce over medium heat until heated through before using. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta. Set aside. Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic to skillet; stir 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and arugula and toss until arugula wilts, 2 to 3 minutes. Add drained pasta to tomato mixture in skillet and toss 1 minute to blend. Add 1 cup crumbled goat cheese to skillet and toss just until cheese softens slightly but does not melt, about 1 minute. Season pasta to taste with salt and black pepper. Transfer pasta to large bowl. Spoon pork and sauce over. Scatter remaining 1/4 cup goat cheese over and serve.",
